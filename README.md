## typescript lib starter

A starter typescript library project.

To get started, `git clone git@github.com:rencire/ts-lib-starter.git <your_project_name>`

## Notes

* Consider replacing `lint-staged` with `https://github.com/nrwl/precise-commits` once its more stable.

* If `npm scripts` is too limiting, consider going old school and use `makefile` for more complicated build workflows:

Of course `make` is not a cross platform solution :/.
